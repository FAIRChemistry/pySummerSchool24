    "Python is a high-level programming language that is widely used in scientific computing. It is known for its readability and ease of use. High-level means that Python is abstracted from the machine code, meaning it resembles human language more closely, and is therefore easier to read and write. Python is an interpreted language, which means that the code is executed line by line. This is different from compiled languages like C or Fortran, where the code is translated into machine code before execution. This makes Python slower than compiled languages, but also easier to use as you can directly see the results of your code. It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world and is used in a wide range of scientific applications."

We believe that neither Python or Excel is superior, but that both are powerful tools which cater to different data analysis requirements. Using Excel for smaller datasets is efficient and easy, but with increasing data complexity or size you may find Python to be more flexible and to be a real time-saver!"
